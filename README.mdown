What the fuck?
==============
This is a Swedish translation with my personal added tweaks. It is not meant to
go into the official “whygitisbetterthanx” website, rather it is to be hosted on
GitHub pages.

I have this idea that every translation ought to be hosted by GitHub pages, where
every translation have one maintainer. The links will then be updated, and if everything
goes really well the CSS and JavaScript will be using external files and all the GitHub
pages can style / behavior updates from the original (english) “whygitisbetterthanx” repository.
